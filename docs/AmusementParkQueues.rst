Model: Amusement Park Queues (PARK-QUEUES)
==========================================

Description:
------------
This model simulates an amusement park with 7 attractions. Tourists arrive at
each attraction according to a poisson  distribution with a rate \[\gamma_i=1\]
i = 1,. . . , 7. Each attraction can only take one tourist at a time, while
others wait in a queue. The park has enough facilities to keep C tourists
waiting across all attractions. These facilities are to be distributed to
create queue capacities \[c_1]\,...,\[c7]\, such that \[\sum_{i=1}^{7} c_i = C\]
If a queue is full, the tourists will immediately leave the park.

After visiting each attraction, a tourist leaves the park with probability 0.2.
Otherwise, the tourist goes to another attraction according to the transition
matrix:

   1   2   3   4   5   6  7
1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0
2 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0
3 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0
4 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0
5 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0 0.1 0.3
6 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0 0.3
7 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2


The time that a tourist spend at an attraction follows an Erlang
distribution with shape parameter k = 2 and rate \[\lambda\] = 9. Without loss of
generality, suppose each attraction is occupied at all time. The park opens at
9AM and closes at 5PM, and the unit of time is minute. When the park closes,
all tourists in the queue leave immediately.

Sources of Randomness:
----------------------
There are 3 sources of randomness in this model:

* The arrival rate of tourists as a poisson distribution with rate of i=1,
i = 1, . . . , 7.

* The probability of 0.2 that a tourist leaves a park after visiting each
attraction and the associated probability matrix of their next attraction
otherwise.

* The time spent at each attraction as an Erlang distribution
with the shape parameter k = 2 and rate =9.

The probability density function of the Erlang distribution is

{\displaystyle f(x;k,\lambda )={\lambda ^{k}x^{k-1}e^{-\lambda x} \over (k-1)!}\quad
 {\mbox{for }}x,\lambda \geq 0,}f(x;k,\lambda )={\lambda ^{k}x^{{k-1}}e^{{-\lambda x}}
 \over (k-1)!}\quad {\mbox{for }}x,\lambda \geq 0,
The parameter k is called the shape parameter, and the parameter
 {\displaystyle \lambda }\lambda  is called the rate parameter.



Model Factors:
--------------
* park_capacity: The total number of tourists waiting for attractions that can
be maintained through park facilities, distributed across the attractions.

    * Default: 350

* number_attractions: The number of attractions in the park.

    * Default: 7

* time_open: The number of minutes per day the park is open.

    * Default: 480

* erlang_shape: The shape parameter of the Erlang distribution for each attraction
duration.

    Default: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

* erlang_rate: The rate parameter of the Erlang distribution for each attraction
    duration.

        Default: [1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9]

* depart_probabilities: The probability that a tourist will depart the park
after visiting an attraction.

    * Default: [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]

* queue_capacities: The capacity of the queues for the attractions based
on the portion of facilities allocated

    * Default: [50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50]

* arrival_gammas: The gamma values for the poisson distributions dictating the
rates at which tourists entering the park arrive at each attraction

    * Default: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

* transition_probabilities: The transition matrix that describes the probability
of a tourist visiting each attraction after their current attraction

    * Default: [[0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0],
    [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0],
    [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0],
    [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0],
    [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.3],
    [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0, 0.3],
    [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2]]

Responses:
---------
* total_departed: The total number of tourists to leave the park due
to full queues

* percent_departed: The percentage of tourists to leave the park due
to full queues

* average_number_in_system: The time average of the number of tourists in the system

* attraction_utilization_percentages: The percent utilizations for each attraction
