Model: Amusement Park Queues (AMUSEMENT)
==========================================

Description:
------------
This model simulates an amusement park with 7 attractions. Tourists arrive at
each attraction according to a poisson  distribution with a rate \gamma_i=1\,
i = 1,. . . , 7. Each attraction can only take one tourist at a time, while
others wait in a queue. The park has enough facilities to keep C tourists
waiting across all attractions. These facilities are to be distributed to
create queue capacities c_1,...,c7, such that the sum of these queue capacities is equivalent to the park capacity, C.

If a queue is full, the tourists will immediately leave the park.

After visiting each attraction, a tourist leaves the park with probability 0.2.
Otherwise, the tourist goes to another attraction according to the transition
matrix:

The time that a tourist spend at an attraction follows an Erlang
distribution with shape parameter k = 2 and rate = 1/9. Without loss of
generality, suppose each attraction is occupied at all time. The park opens at
9AM and closes at 5PM, and the unit of time is minute. When the park closes,
all tourists in the queue leave immediately.

Sources of Randomness:
----------------------
There are 3 sources of randomness in this model:

* The arrival rate of tourists as a poisson distribution with rate of 1 for all i, i = 1, . . . , 7.

* The probability of 0.2 that a tourist leaves a park after visiting each attraction and the associated probability matrix of their next attraction otherwise.

* The time spent at each attraction as an Erlang distribution with the shape parameter k = 2 and rate = 1/9.

The Erlang distribution is the distribution representing a sum of k independent exponential variables with mean 1/lambda each.
The Erlang distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution wherein the shape of the distribution is discretized.


Model Factors:
--------------
* park_capacity: The total number of tourists waiting for attractions that can be maintained through park facilities, distributed across the attractions.

    * Default: 350

* number_attractions: The number of attractions in the park.

    * Default: 7

* time_open: The number of minutes per day the park is open.

    * Default: 480

* erlang_shape: The shape parameter of the Erlang distribution for each attraction duration.

    Default: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

* erlang_rate: The rate parameter of the Erlang distribution for each attraction duration.

        Default: [1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9]

* depart_probabilities: The probability that a tourist will depart the park after visiting an attraction.

    * Default: [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]

* queue_capacities: The capacity of the queues for the attractions based on the portion of facilities allocated

    * Default: [50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50]

* arrival_gammas: The gamma values for the poisson distributions dictating the rates at which tourists entering the park arrive at each attraction

    * Default: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

* transition_probabilities: The transition matrix that describes the probability of a tourist visiting each attraction after their current attraction

    * Default:

Responses:
---------
* total_departed: The total number of tourists to leave the park due to full queues

* percent_departed: The percentage of tourists to leave the park due to full queues

* average_number_in_system: The time average of the number of tourists in the system

* attraction_utilization_percentages: The percent utilizations for each attraction
